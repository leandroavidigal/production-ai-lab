### 📌 Overview

This repository documents a structured 30-week evolution from:

> **Senior Data Engineer → Machine Learning Engineer → Applied AI Engineer → ML Platform Engineer**

This is not a collection of isolated notebooks.

It is a **production-grade AI engineering laboratory**, covering:

- ML systems in production
- Model deployment & monitoring
- RAG architectures
- LLM structured outputs
- Tool-calling agents
- Streaming ML systems
- Observability & cost governance
- Certification preparation (Google PMLE)

---
